	<h1>Audio Panning Demo (Tested in Chrome Only)</h1>
	<p>Use the <b>w</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>d</b> keys or arrow keys to move the background sound around in 3D. The <b>q</b> key toggles the background music on and off. The <b>r</b> and <b>l</b> keys growl right or left respectively.</p>
	<p>This is a demo of the audio API stereo capabilities, so you will need to have the sound on and headphones or stereo speakers for it to have any effect. There is no visible demo (x,y,z positions are reported in the console, though).
